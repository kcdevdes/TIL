Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them 
into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
